# ShootMonster-Interactive game
  Shoot Monster is a game that uses two microbits, one for running the game (implemented in the gun) and the second connected to a computer receiving information from the gun passing it to the processing in the computer.

# Interaction Overview
  The interaction starts with plugging one microbit for communication into the computer, starting running the program in processing, and turning on the gun prototype, which is powered by batteries and starts by pressing the bottom button on its embedded microbit.

  The first step after the gun is turned on is to calibrate the compass by tilting the prototype until the screen is all filled with red dots. Step 2 is pressing the left button to start a new game. This button can be pressed any time to reset the game if needed. Step 3, the game has begun, and the player has 30 seconds to shoot as many monsters as possible (for each monster earns 10 points). Step 4, by pointing a gun in the left-right and up-down direction, the player aims. An aiming cross is displayed on the screen, and also the monster appears on the microbit's screen when it is aimed. Step 5, by pressing the right button, the player shoots. The gun has five bullets, and its current status can be seen in the bottom right corner. When the player runs out of ammo, microbit displays a cross (step 6). Shaking the gun reloads it (step 7). 
  
  At the end of the game, the score is displayed on the screen and on the gun and the game can be repeated by pressing the left button. The game is possible to play without the screen since the monsters appear on the microbit controller.
